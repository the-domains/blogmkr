  A kimono -- literally translated as "the thing worn" -- is a traditional
  Japanese garment defined by its straight seams, "T" shape, and intense
  decorative detail. Although it's been in existence since the late eighth
  century, it wasn't until the late 16th century that the articles of clothing
  began to resemble the long, hanging ensembles we recognize today.
